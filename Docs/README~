Proj No: 	Final Project


Game Concept - 

The player has to avoid colliding with the enemy Jets by either moving or shooting them. After a given while player has to re-fuel the Jet so that it can continue moving. The game ends after lives have been exhausted or the player has travelled a certain distance.

The Specs that I implemented are:

1) AI - The enemies speed up towards the player once they come close enough.

2) Menu 


The Specs that I was unable to implement are:

None as per requirement.


Extra:

Difficulty levels - User can choose between Easy, Medium and Hard.
